Coding Standards & Conventions:

Naming:
1) Use Pascalcase for class names like - MyClass or UserClass
2) Use camelcase for methods like - camelCase() or getUserGuide()
3) Test file names should match the module they test

Comment tricky stuff, but donâ€™t go overboard.
Keep code readable and consistent across all files.
Keep to standard clean indentation.

Write clear commit messages (e.g., fix: resolve login bug).

Follow these branch naming conventions:

        "issue_#<ID>_whateverYouWantToNameIt
        Examples:
                issue_#13_STYLE.md
                issue_#7_ROLES.md
                issue_#10_complete-logo
