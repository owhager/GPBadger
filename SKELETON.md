Here is where you will explain your plan for the Walking Skeleton.
We will talk more about this in the future. In summary, the Walking Skeleton is a
plan for setting up a minimal version of your tech stack. This is less than a MVP
(minimum viable product) as this is not meant to be a product. It is to prove that
you are able to integrate the three main components of your application: front end,
back end, and database.
To complete the Skeleton you must be able to interact with your front end, have
that interaction be sent to your backend, have something be stored in your
database, and return a result back to the front end. This feature does not have to
be particularly powerful or meaningful, but you must prove that you can communicate
between each component of your application.
