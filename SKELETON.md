Front End Interaction: JavaScript: A search bar where users input a course name.A button to submit the query.
Back End Processing: Java: Receive the user input and format it for database querying. Send a request to fetch relevant grade distribution data.
Database Integration: MySQL: Store sample grade data from CSV/API sources. Query stored data based on the user request.
Returning a Response: The backend retrieves relevant results and sends them back to the front end. The front end displays the results in a basic table or graph format.

Implementation of the Walking Skeleton means:
A user can enter a course name.
The request is sent to the backend.
The backend queries the database and retrieves grade distribution data.
The retrieved data is displayed on the front end.
This skeleton serves as the foundation for future feature development and expansion.
